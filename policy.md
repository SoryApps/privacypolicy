You can find information about the use that Sory Apps makes of your personal information.

## About what this privacy policy covers:
This privacy policy applies to information that may be collected by using the mobile applications. This policy does not apply to third independent companies that are not owned or controlled.

## What information is collected:
Privacy is the backbone of our mobile applications, so the objective is not to collect any information if it is not strictly necessary.

Therefore, the only information that is collected is the advertising identifier, due to the presence of advertising in the mobile applications.

## How the information that is collected is used:
The information is only used to provide a specific service: Display advertising that complies with the preferences and restrictions that you have established to.

## What this privacy policy means in practice:
The mobile applications do not collect or transmit any type of user information over the Internet. Therefore, they do not have Internet permission, so they guarantee total privacy and isolation from the network.

The mobile applications, and only those variants of them that show advertising, neither collect nor transmit any type of user information over the Internet. However, to show advertising, these applications integrate an external service (advertising network) that is the one that, from within the applications, autonomously and independently collects and transmits the advertising identifier. Therefore, only these applications require permission and access to the Internet. This external integrated service is independent, it is outside the control of the mobile applications and has (it is governed) with its own privacy policy. You can find more information about the external advertising service by consulting [its website](https://admob.google.com/).

If you want to know more information about the advertising identifier, you can consult the following Web resource https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/ads/ad-id/#ad-id

## Extension:
This section provides information about the philosophy and practice of privacy in [Sory Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sory+Apps) applications.

### About external third-party SDKs, APIs and services:
Only some of the applications with Internet permission make use of some of the external SDKs, APIs and services ([Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)) that Google offers to develop applications.<br/>
Some examples are the [Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview) to display a map in the application or [Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config) to adjust and update the applications.<br/>
It should be noted that they are external and third-party, so they follow their own privacy policy that can be found on their website.<br/>
Something important is to clarify that the applications receive information from these services, but do not transmit personal information that may be on the phone. Information such as photos, GPS location, contacts, etc. is not sent to or leave the phone over the Internet through these apps.

### Use of permissions:
The applications use the permissions that are minimally necessary to perform their functions. In addition, both the listing in the Play Store and the graphical interface of the applications explain, justify and make it clear to users the need for the permissions they request to work.<br/>
The information provided by the permissions is only used locally by the application to provide you with its functions, so the application does not send or transmit it outside of your phone.<br/>
Some examples of permissions:
- [Internet](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#INTERNET): some applications do not have this permission which means that information cannot be sent or received. Applications with this permission use it as described in previous sections of this policy.
- Location or GPS: for example, in the application [Find my car - save parking location](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.soryapps.findmycar), this permission is obvious because the main function of the application is to save where you have parked your car. The application does not force you to grant this permission and only uses it when it is in the foreground (not from background tasks or in the background).

## About what this privacy policy covers:
This privacy policy applies to information that may be collected by using the mobile applications. This policy does not apply to third independent companies that are not owned or controlled.

## What information is collected:
Privacy is the backbone of our mobile applications, so the objective is not to collect any information if it is not strictly necessary.

Therefore, the only information that is collected is the advertising identifier, due to the presence of advertising in the mobile applications.

## How the information that is collected is used:
The information is only used to provide a specific service: Display advertising that complies with the preferences and restrictions that you have established to.

## What this privacy policy means in practice:
The mobile applications do not collect or transmit any type of user information over the Internet. Therefore, they do not have Internet permission, so they guarantee total privacy and isolation from the network.

The mobile applications, and only those variants of them that show advertising, neither collect nor transmit any type of user information over the Internet. However, to show advertising, these applications integrate an external service (advertising network) that is the one that, from within the applications, autonomously and independently collects and transmits the advertising identifier. Therefore, only these applications require permission and access to the Internet. This external integrated service is independent, it is outside the control of the mobile applications and has (it is governed) with its own privacy policy. You can find more information about the external advertising service by consulting [its website](https://admob.google.com/).

If you want to know more information about the advertising identifier, you can consult the following Web resource https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/ads/ad-id/
